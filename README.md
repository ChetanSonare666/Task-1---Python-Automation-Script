# Python Automation Script

## Overview

The File Organizer Automation Script is a Python application that automatically organizes files in a selected folder based on their file extensions. It helps keep directories clean by sorting files into categories such as Images, Documents, Music, Videos, Archives, and Others.

The project also generates a log file to record every operation and uses exception handling to manage errors without crashing.

## Features

* Organizes files automatically based on file extension.
* Creates category folders if they do not already exist.
* Moves files into their respective folders.
* Generates a log file (`operations.log`) for all operations.
* Accepts folder path as user input.
* Uses exception handling for error management.
* Supports multiple common file types.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* OS Module
* Shutil Module
* Logging Module

## Supported File Categories

| Category  | Extensions                |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Images    | .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif   |
| Documents | .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt   |
| Music     | .mp3, .wav                |
| Videos    | .mp4, .mkv, .avi          |
| Archives  | .zip, .rar, .7z           |
| Others    | Any unsupported file type |

## How It Works

1. The user enters the folder path.
2. The program checks whether the folder exists.
3. All files in the folder are scanned.
4. The extension of each file is identified.
5. A destination folder is selected based on the extension.
6. If the destination folder does not exist, it is created automatically.
7. The file is moved to the appropriate folder.
8. Every operation is recorded in `operations.log`.
9. Any errors encountered are handled using exception handling.

## Example

### Before

```text
TestFolder/
│
├── photo.jpg
├── report.pdf
├── song.mp3
├── movie.mp4
├── notes.txt
├── data.xyz
```

### After

```text
TestFolder/

│
├── Documents/
│   ├── report.pdf
│   └── notes.txt
│
├── Music/
│   └── song.mp3
│
├── Videos/
│   └── movie.mp4
